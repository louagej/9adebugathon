On September 10, 2024, we threw a debugathon for Business Central.

The goal? To help folks without a coding background get comfy with debugging in Business Central.

They'll learn how to pop open VS Code from the Business Central web client and kick off a debugging session like pros. 

This way, they'll be quicker at pinpointing the root cause of user issues, whether it's data hiccups or bugs in the AL code.
